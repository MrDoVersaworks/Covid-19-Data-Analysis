Review and Interpretation of the Chart:
The chart provided is a pairplot, showing relationships between variables such as Age, Sex, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, and Mortality (Is_Dead). interpretation of the visual data:
1. Age:
•	The distribution of ages is more spread out, with a higher density between 40 and 70 years old.
•	The orange points (representing patients who died) are more prevalent in the older age groups, suggesting that age may be associated with higher mortality.
2. Sex:
•	There are two distinct categories for sex (represented as 1 and 2, possibly for male and female).
•	The distribution of mortality (orange points) is somewhat balanced between both sexes, indicating that sex may not show a strong relationship with mortality in this sample.
3. Diabetes:
•	Diabetes appears to be binary (represented as 0 for no diabetes and 1 for diabetes).
•	From the chart, there seem to be more orange points (deceased patients) in the group with diabetes, suggesting a positive correlation between diabetes and mortality.
4. Hypertension:
•	Hypertension seems to be represented on a wider range (not binary), though many patients appear to cluster around the lower end.
•	Some deceased patients have higher hypertension values, which could indicate that hypertension may contribute to mortality.
5. Obesity:
•	Obesity, like hypertension, seems to have a wider range but with many patients clustered at the lower values.
•	It is harder to discern a clear trend in mortality with obesity from this specific plot, but further statistical analysis may be needed to confirm its impact.
6. Mortality (Is_Dead):
•	The orange and blue points represent whether the patient is deceased (1) or alive (0).
•	The relationships between each variable and mortality can be inferred based on the spread of orange points across the charts.
Key Findings:
•	Age and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension appear to be associated with higher mortality. As the age of the patient increases, so does the likelihood of mortality.
•	Sex does not seem to have a strong impact on the mortality rate in this particular dataset.

Summary of Findings:
The analysis of the dataset aimed to identify key factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. The following insights were derived from the visual data:
1.	Age is a significant factor in mortality. Older patients, particularly those between 40 and 70, had a higher likelihood of death, as observed in the higher density of orange points representing deceased patients in this age range.
2.	Diabetes shows a positive correlation with mortality. Patients with diabetes were more likely to die, as evidenced by the concentration of orange points in the group with diabetes.
3.	Hypertension may also contribute to mortality. Some patients with higher hypertension levels were observed to have died, suggesting that hypertension is a risk factor, though further statistical analysis is needed to confirm the strength of this relationship.
4.	Sex does not appear to have a strong impact on the likelihood of mortality, with both sexes showing similar distributions in terms of death and survival.
5.	Obesity does not show a clear visual correlation with mortality, though further statistical testing could clarify its role.
Conclusion:
The key factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in this dataset are age, diabetes, and possibly hypertension. Sex and obesity do not appear to show strong associations based on the visual data.

Project: COVID-19 Mortality Analysis
Overview:
This project involves the analysis of a dataset to identify the key factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. The dataset contains patient information on variables like age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The analysis aims to determine which factors contribute most to patient death.
Analysis Process:
1.	Data Loading & Cleaning:
The dataset was cleaned, and a binary column for mortality (Is_Dead) was created based on the presence of a death date.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
A pairplot was used to visualize the relationships between key features and mortality. The plot highlights the trends and correlations between age, comorbidities, and patient outcomes.
3.	Key Findings:
o	Age: Older patients are more likely to die.
o	Diabetes: Patients with diabetes are more likely to die.
o	Hypertension: High levels of hypertension may be linked to mortality.
o	Sex and Obesity: No clear relationship with mortality was found.
Conclusion:
Age and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension are key factors in mortality. Future work could involve statistical testing to quantify the strength of these relationships.
How to Use the Code:
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Install the necessary Python packages:
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
3.	Run the script:
python analysis.py
4.	The script will output a chart that visualizes the relationships between key variables and mortality.
